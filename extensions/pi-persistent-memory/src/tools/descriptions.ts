export const SAVE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Persist confirmed reusable knowledge: decisions, project conventions, verified bug causes/fixes, lessons, or explicit user preferences. ' +
  'action="save" (default) requires non-empty English title, content with source/context, and type (e.g. note, decision, lesson). ' +
  'Use a stable topic_key (e.g. convention/test-runner) to insert or update the same topic in the target scope; use a known id to update a selected record. ' +
  'Updates replace title/content/type, not merge them: read existing knowledge with memory_get first and preserve still-valid facts. When updating by id, pass its existing topic_key to retain it; omitting the key clears it. Omitting id and topic_key creates a new record. ' +
  'Writes default to the current resolved scope; scope="global" is only for authorized cross-project knowledge. Never save secrets, task progress, raw logs, full artifacts, or speculation. ' +
  'Save type="session_summary" ONLY after an explicit user request; omit topic_key to let the tool assign the reserved session key. ' +
  'Check the returned id, committed, indexed, indexing_status and any error: text may be saved while embeddings remain pending. ' +
  'action="reindex" retries pending embeddings without changing text; omit title/content/type/topic_key, use id for one record in the current scope or omit id for batches of at most 5. ' +
  'For bulk reindex, reuse returned next_cursor with the same global selection; global=true targets pending records across projects.';

export const SEARCH_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Recall relevant historical knowledge before repeating investigation or making decisions. ' +
  'Use hybrid (default) for topical recall, semantic for conceptual similarity, fts5 for lexical technical identifiers, paths, or errors (no embedding request), ' +
  'or graph for a bounded relationship neighborhood (2 hops, <=20 entities). English query is required for hybrid/semantic/fts5, preserving technical literals. ' +
  'Graph requires a known entity_id from memory_entity or the orchestrator, not an integer memory ID; omit query and cursor. ' +
  'Reads default to the current project; global=true includes other projects and global records but grants no write authority. ' +
  'Results contain excerpts (<=5 memories per page); use memory_get on selected IDs before relying on them and corroborate with current evidence. ' +
  'Continue only as needed with returned next_cursor as cursor and the same query, mode and global selection; never invent cursors. ' +
  'Inspect actual_mode and warnings for lexical fallback. Empty results mean no matches, not necessarily an empty database. If a cursor expires after changes, restart the query.';

export const GET_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Read the full stored title and content of an active memory selected through memory_search or memory_context. ' +
  'Requires a positive integer id; entity IDs are not memory IDs. Returns UTF-8 bounded pages, not necessarily the whole record in one call. ' +
  'Continue with returned next_cursor as cursor, keeping the same id and global flag, until complete when relying on or updating the record. ' +
  'global=true permits relevant cross-project reads, not writes. Corroborate historical claims with current evidence. ' +
  'Deleted records cannot be read: use authorized memory_deleted_list and memory_restore first.';

export const CONTEXT_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Orient a non-trivial task when prior project knowledge may help, without composing a query; call with {} for the current scope. ' +
  'Returns excerpts prioritized by active session summary (if present), project summary, then recent memories. Missing summaries are normal, not generated automatically. ' +
  'Use memory_get to read selected IDs fully and memory_search for a specific topic; this snapshot is not an exhaustive search. ' +
  'global=true includes cross-project records after local priority. Continue only when needed with returned next_cursor and the same global selection.';

export const DELETE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Soft-delete a known active memory only for an explicitly authorized deletion task; recoverable with memory_restore, not a permanent purge. ' +
  'Requires id and owner_scope matching the record (project or global); for a global record from a project session also set scope="global". ' +
  'Does not move records between projects. Read the target first, confirm the scope, and check the returned deletion status. Hidden records are absent from ordinary search/get.';

export const RESTORE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Recover a soft-deleted memory for an explicitly authorized recovery task. Locate its id and owner with memory_deleted_list first. ' +
  'Requires id and matching owner_scope; for a global record from a project session also set scope="global". ' +
  'Restores text and lexical visibility, with vector indexing pending: read with memory_get and use memory_save(action="reindex", id) in the owning scope when needed. ' +
  'Restoring does not automatically regenerate embeddings or move the record between projects.';

export const DELETED_LIST_DESCRIPTION =
  'Find recoverable memories before an authorized memory_restore operation. Returns metadata only: id, title, owner, type, deleted_at; deleted content remains hidden. ' +
  'Defaults to the current scope; global=true includes deleted records across projects. Use returned owner to assert owner_scope when restoring. ' +
  'Continue as needed with returned next_cursor as cursor and unchanged global selection; do not restore records merely because they appear in this list.';

export const ENTITY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Look up graph entity IDs or save canonical entities when graph management is authorized. Types: project, technology, file, concept, memory. ' +
  'action="get" requires a known string id; action="list" discovers IDs and can filter by type, continuing with returned next_cursor and unchanged type/global selection. ' +
  'action="save" requires type and name; optional id updates a known entity, otherwise canonical identity determines upsert. ' +
  'type="memory" requires positive integer memory_id referencing an active memory; omit memory_id for other types. File names are project-relative paths. ' +
  'Entity IDs and memory IDs differ; types, scopes and memory associations cannot be changed on update. ' +
  'scope selects writes (current resolved scope by default); global=true expands get/list reads only. Use returned IDs for memory_search(mode="graph") or memory_relation.';

export const RELATION_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Save or delete directed graph relations only when graph management is authorized. ' +
  'action="save" requires existing source and target entity IDs plus relation_type: uses, about, references, depends_on, related_to, contradicts. ' +
  'Find endpoints with memory_entity, never invent IDs or use integer memory IDs. Optional id updates a known relation; identical endpoint/type/scope saves reuse the existing relation. ' +
  'action="delete" requires a known relation id and explicit deletion authorization; deletes the edge, not its endpoint entities. ' +
  'scope selects the target write scope, not cross-project access. Endpoints must be compatible with that scope; use graph search to inspect stored direction.';

export const HISTORY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION =
  'Search and retrieve human user message history across all sessions of the current project only. ' +
  'action="search" queries messages chronologically (omit query to list recent project messages, or provide lexical full-text query; optional session_id filter). ' +
  'action="get" retrieves full message content by positive integer id. ' +
  'History is strictly project-isolated: linked Git worktrees share history, independent clones and different projects remain separated. ' +
  'Never invent or forge cursors; cross-project queries and global scope fail closed.';
